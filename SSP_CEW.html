                <h2>Emergency Funding</h2>
                <p>Do you have <strong>unmet financial needs</strong> related to your living expenses or a life event has affected your financial situation?</p>
                <p>Apply for emergency funding! </p>
                  <p> Get support for: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>rent</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>food</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>medical expenses</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                <p> <strong> and more.</strong>  </p>
                    
                    <p>To qualify, you must have filled out and submitted the <strong>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</strong> and 
                        your financial aid package must demonstate that you have unmet financial needs.(ie. your financial aid package shows that you still owe money for tuition, housing, food, other expenses etc.)</p>
                        
                    <p>There are many reasons to update your financial aid package, including but not limited to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>show your <strong>living expenses</strong></li>
                        <li>show your <strong>medical</strong> expenses, including <strong>prescriptions</strong></li>
                        <li>show your <strong>childcare</strong> expenses</li>
                        <li>show your  <strong>transportation</strong> expenses </li>
                        <li>make room for any additional <strong> financial aid/emergency funding </strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The university utilizes a John Doe fund in order to establish what they expect every student to spend on their living expenses. Sometimes, your spending cannot fit into 
                        what they estimate you will spend. This is why it is important to update your financial aid package to reflect this and 
                        to apply for Emergency Funding.
                    </p>
